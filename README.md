# RagView

Why RagView？

As RAG technology continues to evolve, there are now nearly 60 distinct approaches, reflecting a stage of diversity and rapid experimentation. Depending on the scenario, different RAG solutions may yield significantly different outcomes in terms of recall rate, accuracy, and F1 score. Beyond accuracy, enterprises and individual developers must also weigh factors such as computational cost, performance, framework maturity, and scalability. However, there is currently no unified platform that consolidates and compares these RAG technologies. Developers and enterprises are often forced to download open-source code, deploy systems independently, and run manual evaluations—an inefficient and costly process.

To address this gap, we are building RagView—a benchmarking and selection platform for RAG technologies, designed for both developers and enterprises. RagView provides standardized evaluation metrics, streamlined benchmarking workflows, intuitive visualization tools, and a modular plug-in architecture, enabling users to efficiently compare RAG solutions and select the approach best suited to their specific business needs.

We are a small, passion-driven team. While our technical expertise may not be exceptional, we are fueled by curiosity and commitment to learning. Through continuous exploration and iteration, we strive to grow and evolve—aiming to make RagView a truly valuable tool for developers and enterprises.

The project is still under development, and we look forward to your attention and support!
